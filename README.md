Wang-Buzsaki model with Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method for three inhibitory neurons for connect to the Feed Back Loop

## Graph theory

In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a vertex (plural vertices) or node is the fundamental unit of which graphs are formed: an undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges (unordered pairs of vertices), while a directed graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of arcs (ordered pairs of vertices).

## Feed Back Loop

Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to feed back into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems:

Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the second and second system influences the first, leading to a circular argument. This makes reasoning based upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole. For a three node pattern there exitst 13 possible ways to create a directed (with arrows of definite direction) subgraph.

## Wang-Buzsaki
The Wang-Buzsaki model uses the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism to describe a single-compartment neuron with sodium and potassium conductances. For the transient sodium current, the activation variable m is assumed fast and substituted by its steady-state function.

## Runge-Kutta
Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method to Solve Differential Equation Runge Kutta method is used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODE). It uses dy/dx function for x and y, and also need the initial value of y, i.e. y(0). It finds the approximate value of y for given x. For solving ODE, we have to follow these formulas:
